/opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages/pytorch_lightning/trainer/connectors/data_connector.py:492: Your `val_dataloader`'s sampler has shuffling enabled, it is strongly recommended that you turn shuffling off for val/test dataloaders.
/opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages/pytorch_lightning/trainer/connectors/data_connector.py:441: The 'val_dataloader' does not have many workers which may be a bottleneck. Consider increasing the value of the `num_workers` argument` to `num_workers=19` in the `DataLoader` to improve performance.
